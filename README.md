# Time Series Power Consumption Analysis ⚡📈

This project analyzes **time series power consumption data** to uncover trends, seasonality, anomalies, and provide predictive insights. It uses Python with popular data science and machine learning libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting.

## 📌 Features

* Load and preprocess power consumption dataset
* Handle missing values and outliers
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with plots
* Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)
* Build forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc. – depending on notebook implementation)
* Evaluate model performance with standard metrics

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
python >= 3.8
jupyter
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
prophet   # if used
tensorflow/keras  # if LSTM is used
```

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You may create a `requirements.txt` from the notebook with `pipreqs` or `pip freeze`.)*

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Time_series_power_consumption.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells step by step to:

   * Explore dataset
   * Train forecasting models
   * Visualize predictions

## 📊 Example Output

* Line plots of power consumption over time
* Seasonal-trend decomposition graphs
* Forecast vs. actual comparison plots
* Model accuracy metrics

```

## 🔮 Future Work

* Deploy forecasting model as a web app (Streamlit/Dash)
* Add anomaly detection module
* Automate data pipeline for real-time predictions
